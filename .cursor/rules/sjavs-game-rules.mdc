# Sjavs Game Rules - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Sjavs (pronounced "shouse") is a traditional Faroese card game of the Schafkopf family. This document provides comprehensive rules and implementation guidance for the digital version.

### Game Classification
- **Family**: Schafkopf group
- **Players**: 4 (in partnerships)
- **Deck**: 32 cards (standard 52-card deck minus 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s)
- **Origin**: Faroe Islands
- **Complexity**: Medium-High

## Players and Seating

### Partnership Structure
- **Total Players**: 4
- **Teams**: 2 partnerships (Team A vs Team B)
- **Seating**: Partners sit opposite each other
- **Communication**: No explicit communication allowed between partners during play

### Seating Arrangement
```
    Player 2 (North)
         |
Player 1 --- Player 3
(West)        (East)
         |
    Player 4 (South)
```
- **Partnership 1**: Players 1 & 3 (West-East)
- **Partnership 2**: Players 2 & 4 (North-South)

## Card System

### Deck Composition
- **Base Deck**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Removed Cards**: All 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s (20 cards removed)
- **Remaining**: 32 cards total

### Trump Hierarchy
The trump system is the most complex aspect of Sjavs:

#### Permanent Trumps (Always Trump Regardless of Suit)
1. **♣Q** (Club Queen) - Highest trump
2. **♠Q** (Spade Queen)
3. **♣J** (Club Jack)
4. **♠J** (Spade Jack)
5. **♥J** (Heart Jack)
6. **♦J** (Diamond Jack) - Lowest permanent trump

#### Non-Trump Card Rankings
For all suits (including the trump suit itself), the remaining cards rank:
**A > K > (Q)* > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7**

*Note: Q only ranks here if it's not a permanent trump (i.e., ♥Q or ♦Q when hearts/diamonds are not trump)*

#### Trump Count by Suit
- **Red Suits (♥/♦) as Trump**: 13 total trumps (6 permanent + 7 suit cards)
- **Black Suits (♣/♠) as Trump**: 12 total trumps (6 permanent + 6 suit cards, since that suit's Q is permanent)

### Card Point Values
- **Ace (A)**: 11 points
- **King (K)**: 4 points
- **Queen (Q)**: 3 points
- **Jack (J)**: 2 points
- **Ten (10)**: 10 points
- **Nine (9)**: 0 points
- **Eight (8)**: 0 points
- **Seven (7)**: 0 points

**Total Points in Deck**: 120 points

## Deal Process

### Dealer Selection
- **Initial Dealer**: Random selection or agreed upon
- **Subsequent Deals**: Rotates clockwise after each hand

### Cut Decision
The player to dealer's right has two options:
1. **Cut the deck**: Dealer deals 4 cards at a time to each player
2. **Tap/Knock**: Dealer deals 8 cards at a time to each player

### Implementation Note
The tapping/knocking mechanism is a traditional element that could be simplified in digital implementation to a binary choice: "Normal Deal" (4 at a time) vs "Fast Deal" (8 at a time).

## Trump Suit Selection (Bidding Phase)

### Bidding Order
Starting with dealer's left-hand neighbor, proceeding clockwise.

### Bidding Rules
1. **First Opportunity**: Dealer's left neighbor speaks first
2. **Initial Bid**: Must state the length of their longest possible trump suit (if 5+ cards)
3. **Pass Option**: If no 5+ card trump suit, player says "Pass"
4. **Subsequent Bids**: Players must have a "better holding" than any already announced
5. **Better Holding Definition**: 
   - A longer trump suit (e.g., 7 beats 6), OR
   - Same length but in clubs (clubs beats any other suit of same length)

### Bidding Examples
- Player 1: "6 trumps" (hearts)
- Player 2: "6 trumps" (clubs) ✅ Valid - clubs beats hearts at same length
- Player 3: "7 trumps" (spades) ✅ Valid - longer length beats clubs
- Player 4: Pass ✅ Valid - no better holding

### Bidding Logic
- Player counts potential trumps including the 6 permanent trumps
- Must declare exact count of longest possible trump suit
- Club preference applies only when comparing holdings of equal length
- Last player with a valid "better holding" wins the bid

### Bid Resolution
- **Winner**: Player with the best holding (longest length, or clubs if tied)
- **Trump Suit Declaration**: Winner declares which suit is trump
- **Club Obligation**: If winner has multiple suits of equal winning length and one is clubs, must declare clubs
- **Re-deal**: If no player has 5+ trumps, same dealer deals again

### Implementation Note
Re-deal probably will not be needed in this digital version because we're just going to keep generating decks until one guarentees that atleast 1 player can declare valid trump suit

### Implementation Considerations
- Calculate trump count for each possible suit (including 6 permanent trumps)
- Compare holdings: longer length always wins, clubs wins ties
- Track bidding sequence to determine final winner
- Validate minimum 5-trump requirement

## Gameplay

### Game Structure
- **Total Tricks**: 8 tricks per game (32 cards ÷ 4 players)
- **Cards per Player**: 8 cards (each player plays 1 card per trick)
- **Trick Definition**: One round where each of the 4 players plays exactly 1 card

### Trick-Taking Rules
1. **Lead**: Dealer's left-hand neighbor leads first trick
2. **Play Order**: Clockwise from the lead player
3. **Follow Suit**: Must follow the suit of the led card if possible
4. **Trump/Discard**: If cannot follow suit, may trump or discard any card freely
5. **Trick Winner**: Determined by trick-winning hierarchy (see below)
6. **Next Lead**: Winner of the current trick leads the next trick

### How to Win a Trick
The winner is determined by this hierarchy (highest priority first):

1. **Highest Trump Wins**: If any trumps are played, the highest trump wins the trick
2. **Highest Led Suit Wins**: If no trumps are played, the highest card of the led suit wins

### Trump Hierarchy in Tricks
When multiple trumps are played in a trick:

#### Permanent Trumps vs Suit Trumps
- **Permanent trumps always beat suit trumps** (even high ones like Ace of trump suit)

#### Among Permanent Trumps (highest to lowest):
1. **♣Q** (Club Queen) - Always highest trump
2. **♠Q** (Spade Queen)
3. **♣J** (Club Jack)
4. **♠J** (Spade Jack)
5. **♥J** (Heart Jack)
6. **♦J** (Diamond Jack) - Lowest permanent trump

#### Among Suit Trumps (of the declared trump suit):
**A > K > Q* > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7**
*Q only applies if hearts/diamonds are trump (since club/spade Queens are permanent trumps)

### Trick Examples

**Example 1 - No Trumps Played:**
- Lead: ♥K (hearts)
- Player 2: ♥9 (follows suit)
- Player 3: ♥A (follows suit)
- Player 4: ♠7 (cannot follow, discards)
- **Winner**: Player 3 with ♥A (highest of led suit)

**Example 2 - Trump Played:**
- Lead: ♥K (hearts, not trump)
- Player 2: ♦10 (diamonds are trump)
- Player 3: ♥A (follows suit)
- Player 4: ♣Q (permanent trump)
- **Winner**: Player 4 with ♣Q (permanent trump beats all)

**Example 3 - Multiple Trumps (diamonds are trump):**
- Lead: ♠8 (spades)
- Player 2: ♣Q (permanent trump)
- Player 3: ♦A (suit trump)
- Player 4: ♠J (permanent trump)
- **Winner**: Player 2 with ♣Q (highest permanent trump)

### Critical Implementation Rules
- **Trump Identification**: Must correctly identify which cards are trumps based on declared suit
- **Suit Following**: Complex logic needed for permanent trumps (they belong to trump suit, not original suit)
- **Valid Play Validation**: Ensure players follow suit when able

## Scoring System

### Point Thresholds and Scores
The team that **declared trump** is evaluated based on points won:

| Points Won | Trump Team Score | Opposing Team Score | Notes |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 120 (All tricks) | 12 (16 if clubs) | 0 | "Vol" - Perfect game |
| 90-119 | 4 (8 if clubs) | 0 | Strong victory |
| 61-89 | 2 (4 if clubs) | 0 | Standard victory |
| 31-60 | 0 | 4 (8 if clubs) | Failed to make game |
| 1-30 | 0 | 8 (16 if clubs) | Poor performance |
| 0 (No tricks) | 0 | 16 | Complete failure |

### Special Scoring Rules
- **Tie at 60-60**: No score, next game value increased by 2
- **Individual Vol**: If one player from trump team takes all tricks, team scores 16 (24 if clubs)
- **Club Bonus**: All scores doubled when clubs are trump

### Terminology
- **Vol**: Taking all 8 tricks
- **At vera javnfrujjur**: Scoring 31+ points (avoiding double loss)

## Rubber Scoring

### Rubber System
- **Target**: First team to reach 0 or below wins rubber
- **Starting Score**: 24 points per team
- **Scoring Method**: Subtract game points from current total
- **Victory Condition**: Reach 0 or negative score

### Score Sheet Format
```
We  | They
----+-----
24  | 24    (Starting scores)
20  | 24    (We won 4 points)
20  | 16    (They won 8 points)
18  | 16    (We won 2 points)
18  | 0     (They won 16 points - RUBBER WIN)
```

### Special Conditions
- **Double Victory**: Winner reaches 0 while opponent still at 24
- **On the Hook**: Team with exactly 6 points remaining
- **Victory Marking**: Cross (×) marked in winner's column

### Implementation Notes
- Track running totals for both teams
- Handle double victory detection
- Implement "on the hook" status tracking

## Edge Cases and Clarifications

### Bidding Edge Cases
1. **Club Preference in Action**: When two players bid same length, clubs wins regardless of bidding order
2. **Final Trump Selection**: Winner with multiple equal-length suits must choose clubs if available
3. **No Valid Bids**: Re-deal with same dealer if no player has 5+ trump holding

### Gameplay Edge Cases
1. **Trump Suit Following**: Permanent trumps are considered part of trump suit for following
2. **Last Trick**: Important for reaching exactly 60 points (tie scenario)
3. **Misplay Handling**: Need clear rules for invalid plays in digital version

### Scoring Edge Cases
1. **Exact 60-60 Tie**: Rare but important case
2. **Rubber Tie**: Both teams reach 0 simultaneously (should not happen with proper scoring)
3. **Individual Vol vs Team Vol**: Different scoring implications

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Game
1. Deck management and card identification
2. Basic trick-taking engine
3. Trump suit selection logic
4. Point counting system

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Rubber scoring system
2. Game state validation
3. Tournament support
4. Statistics tracking

### Phase 3: Polish
1. Traditional terminology integration
2. Cultural authenticity features

- **History**: Trick history for scoring and analysis

### Data Structures
- **Card Representation**: Suit + rank with trump calculation
- **Player State**: Hand, score, partnership
- **Game Rules**: Configurable for variations

### Performance Considerations
- **Trump Calculation**: Pre-calculate trump status for efficiency
- **Valid Play Generation**: Cache legal moves
- **Scoring**: Efficient point counting algorithms
