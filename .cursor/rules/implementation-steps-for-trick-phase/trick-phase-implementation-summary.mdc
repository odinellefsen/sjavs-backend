# Trick Phase Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the **Trick Phase Implementation** for the Sjavs backend. This phase handles the core card-playing gameplay after bidding completes, including trick-taking mechanics, authentic Sjavs scoring, and Cross/Rubber management.

## Implementation Architecture

### Foundations ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Game State Transitions**: From `NormalMatchStatus::Bidding` to `Playing` to `Completed`
- **Card Management**: Full deck system with authentic Sjavs trump hierarchy
- **Player Management**: 4-player partnerships with turn rotation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with Clerk integration
- **Redis Infrastructure**: High-performance connection pooling for 1000+ users

### 5-Step Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Current State Analysis & Foundation ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Current Implementation Assessment
**✅ Validated Existing Infrastructure:**
- Game state management with `NormalMatch` status transitions
- Card dealing and hand storage via `GameStateRepository` 
- Trump hierarchy with `Card::beats()` method for authentic Sjavs rules
- Player-game associations and turn management
- WebSocket broadcasting for real-time updates
- Redis storage with proper serialization

**❌ Required New Components:**
- Trick state tracking (current trick, cards played, turn order)
- Card playing validation and endpoint
- Point counting and team scoring
- Game completion detection
- Cross/Rubber scoring system

### Data Structures Designed
```rust
// Core trick state tracking
pub struct TrickState {
    pub trick_number: u8,           // 1-8
    pub lead_suit: Option<Suit>,    // Follow suit requirements
    pub cards_played: Vec<(usize, Card)>, // Player positions and cards
    pub current_player: usize,      // Turn management
    pub trick_winner: Option<usize>, // Winner after 4 cards
    pub is_complete: bool,          // Completion status
}

// Game-wide scoring and state
pub struct GameTrickState {
    pub current_trick: TrickState,
    pub tricks_won: (u8, u8),          // Team trick counts
    pub points_accumulated: (u8, u8),   // Team point totals
    pub trump_team: (usize, usize),     // Partnership tracking
    pub game_complete: bool,            // 8-trick completion
}
```

## Step 2: Trick State Management ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Core Trick Infrastructure
**File: `src/game/trick.rs`**
- Complete `TrickState` struct with validation methods
- Turn-based card playing with `play_card()` method
- Automatic trick winner determination using existing `Card::beats()`
- Follow suit validation with `get_legal_cards()`
- Game-wide `GameTrickState` for complete match tracking

### Key Features Implemented
- **Turn Validation**: Ensures correct player order
- **Follow Suit Logic**: Must follow lead suit if possible
- **Trick Completion**: Automatic winner detection after 4 cards
- **Point Calculation**: Card point values (A=11, K=4, Q=3, J=2, 10=10)
- **Team Tracking**: Trump team vs opponents with partnership logic

### Redis Storage Extensions
**File: `src/redis/trick_state/repository.rs`**
- `TrickStateRepository` for persistent trick state storage
- Completed trick history for debugging and validation
- Redis key patterns: `game_trick_state:{game_id}`, `game_trick_history:{game_id}:{trick_number}`

### Integration Points
- Extended `NormalMatch` with trick management methods
- Integration with existing Redis infrastructure
- Leverages established connection pooling and serialization

## Step 3: Card Playing Endpoint ✅ **COMPLETED**

### HTTP API Implementation
**File: `src/api/handlers/game_trick.rs`**

#### `POST /game/play-card` Endpoint
```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, ToSchema)]
pub struct PlayCardRequest {
    pub card_code: String,  // e.g., "AS", "QC", "7H"
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, ToSchema)]
pub struct PlayCardResponse {
    pub message: String,
    pub game_id: String,
    pub player_position: u8,
    pub card_played: String,
    pub trick_state: TrickStateInfo,
    pub trick_complete: bool,
    pub trick_winner: Option<u8>,
    pub trick_points: Option<u8>,
    pub game_complete: bool,
}
```

### Comprehensive Validation Pipeline
1. **Authentication**: JWT token validation
2. **Game State**: Must be in `Playing` status
3. **Player Turn**: Validates correct turn order
4. **Card Ownership**: Player must have the card in hand
5. **Legal Play**: Must follow suit if possible
6. **Card Removal**: Updates player hand after play

### Real-Time Updates
**WebSocket Broadcasting:**
- Card played events to all players
- Trick completion notifications
- Game state updates
- Score updates after each trick

### Error Handling
- Detailed error responses for invalid plays
- Turn validation with helpful messages
- Card validation with specific feedback
- State consistency checking

## Step 4: Game Completion & Sjavs Scoring ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Authentic Sjavs Scoring Engine
**File: `src/game/scoring.rs`**

#### Scoring Rules Implementation
```rust
pub struct SjavsScoring {
    pub trump_team_points: u8,      // Actual points won
    pub opponent_team_points: u8,   // Opponent points
    pub trump_team_tricks: u8,      // Tricks won by trump team
    pub opponent_team_tricks: u8,   // Tricks won by opponents
    pub trump_suit: String,         // For club bonus calculation
    pub individual_vol: bool,       // Single player won all tricks
}
```

#### Complete Scoring Matrix
**Vol Scoring (All 8 Tricks):**
- **Individual Vol**: 16 points (24 for clubs)
- **Team Vol**: 12 points (16 for clubs)  
- **Opponent Vol**: 16 points (always)

**Normal Scoring (Trump Team Points):**
- **90-120 points**: 4 points (8 for clubs)
- **61-89 points**: 2 points (4 for clubs)
- **31-59 points**: Opponents get 4 points (8 for clubs) - "avoiding double loss"
- **0-30 points**: Opponents get 8 points (16 for clubs) - "double loss"

**Special Cases:**
- **60-60 Tie**: No score, next game worth +2 bonus points
- **Club Trump**: All scores doubled (authentic Faroese tradition)

### Individual Vol Detection
Advanced logic to detect when a single player (not just team) won all 8 tricks:
```rust
impl GameTrickState {
    pub fn check_individual_vol(&self) -> bool {
        // Analyzes trick winners to detect single-player domination
        // Awards maximum points for this rare achievement
    }
}
```

### Game Completion Handler
**File: `src/api/handlers/game_scoring.rs`**

#### `POST /game/complete` Endpoint
- Automatically triggered when 8th trick completes
- Calculates final Sjavs scoring with all rules
- Validates point totals (must equal 120)
- Applies scoring to Cross/Rubber system
- Broadcasts game completion to all players

### Point Validation
- **Total Points Check**: Trump + Opponent points must equal 120
- **Trick Consistency**: All 8 tricks must be accounted for
- **Card Point Accuracy**: Validates card point calculations
- **Partnership Logic**: Ensures correct team attributions

## Step 5: Cross/Rubber Management ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Authentic Cross/Rubber System
**File: `src/game/cross.rs`**

#### Cross State Management
```rust
pub struct CrossState {
    pub trump_team_score: i8,       // Starts at 24, counts down
    pub opponent_team_score: i8,    // Starts at 24, counts down  
    pub trump_team_crosses: u8,     // Crosses won by trump team
    pub opponent_team_crosses: u8,  // Crosses won by opponents
    pub next_game_bonus: u8,        // From tie games
    pub rubber_complete: bool,      // Match completion status
}
```

#### Cross Completion Logic
- **Cross Winner**: First team to reach 0 or below wins cross
- **Double Victory**: Winner reaches 0 while opponent still at 24
- **"On the Hook"**: Traditional warning when team reaches 6 points
- **Rubber System**: Multiple crosses determine overall match winner

#### Tie Game Handling
- **60-60 Ties**: Add 2 bonus points to next game winner
- **Bonus Accumulation**: Multiple ties can stack bonuses
- **Bonus Application**: Applied automatically to next game winner

### Redis Storage System
**File: `src/redis/cross_state/repository.rs`**
- `CrossStateRepository` for persistent cross state storage
- Automatic cross state initialization for new matches
- Cross completion detection and storage
- Redis key pattern: `cross_state:{match_id}`

### Integration with Game Completion
- **Automatic Scoring**: Game results automatically applied to cross scores
- **Cross Detection**: Real-time cross completion checking
- **Match Progression**: Handles new game setup within rubber
- **Final Results**: Complete match results with cross winners

## API Endpoints Summary
